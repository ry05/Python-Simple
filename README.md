# Easing out the Python Learning Curve
Simple beginner level codes in Python.

### Backstory - The reason why I created this repo
I was never a fan of coding until I met Python. I wrote these programs in my fresher year at undergrad to practice my Python skills. <br>
That's when I realised that if I could publish these on some platform, it could help several **Non-coder** friends I had who found it difficult to learn programming.<br>
**Main Points :**
* Python is simple for beginners and it is not as intimidating as C or Java
* Writing small code snippets is a very effective way to learn a language, atleast that's how it helped me

**NOTE :** Very basic, lacks a distinct style guide, not the most optimized - But, I hope these would help **Non-coders** to grasp *basic coding skills*. 

### My Beginner-Level Guide
* This is something I made while I was the Secretary of the CSE Departmental Forum at Amrita School of Engineering, Bengaluru.<br>
* It was well-received at the college due to its fairly simple nature. But, I would let you be the judge of that.

### Future Work
I will continue working on this repo as and when I can and shall improve the repo by making it more **visually-appealing** for beginners; especially those making a transition from a **non-coding background to a coding one**.
